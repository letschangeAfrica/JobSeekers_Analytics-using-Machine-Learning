# JobSeekers Analytics using Machine Learning

![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1200x400?text=JobSeekers+Analytics+ML+Project)

A machine learning project to streamline recruitment processes by predicting application approval status based on candidate profiles.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project leverages the **JobSeekers_Analytics** dataset to build a classification model that:
- Predicts whether a job applicant's profile will be approved
- Identifies key factors influencing hiring decisions
- Reduces manual screening efforts by up to 40%

Built using the **CRISP-ML(Q)** methodology for maximum transparency and reproducibility.

## 🎯 Business Objectives

**Problem:**  
Hiring managers are overwhelmed with hundreds of applications while quality candidates get missed in manual screening.

**Solution:**  
An ML model that:
- Achieves ≥85% accuracy in predicting application status
- Reduces screening costs by 20%
- Provides explainable decisions for HR teams

## 📊 Dataset

**JobSeekers_Analytics Dataset (30 features):**
- 1,155 applicant records
- 7 categories of features:
  - Demographics
  - Education & Skills
  - Professional Background
  - Job Preferences
  - Application Metrics
  - Social Presence
  - Target: `Application_Status` (Approved/Rejected/Pending)
